Meeting notes: The group met to get to know one another and assign roles based on group consensus. David was assigned tech lead due to his Android experience. Neal and Chandana would figure out which would be the manager between each other and then inform the group about their decision. Developers were tasked with getting acquainted with Android from guides and tools David will set out. We left with group members needing clarification on the deliverable for how many screenshots were needed, Neal's legal code contribution ability, whether Manav had dropped the class or not, and final manager decisions

Meeting notes: We discussed a standardized testing environment so everyone will be testing from the same setup. We discussed a work process where group members will grab an activity they will want to work on and notify the group. The member will think up tests, share the ideas with at least one other person on the group so that they can provide critque. Make the tests. Have someone else test them, and see if there are other tests you missed or should make. Then open it up to the group. We also cancelled the meeting next week. We also discussed bonus point assignments and if anyone is interested in that.
